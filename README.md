# Butter_CMS_Utilities
An unofficial collection of client-side utilities for Butter CMS that I found myself needing but aren't available out of the box (yet).

## 🎯 Why This Exists
While working with Butter CMS, I needed certain utilities for searching and managing content that surprisingly weren't provided by default. Rather than building these into a larger project or waiting for official tools, I created this simple, no-frills utility page.

## 🤖 Why AI?
I used AI to scaffold this project because:

- I needed a quick, simple tool without the overhead of frameworks
- AI helped me iterate faster on something that's meant to be functional, not fancy

I did have to convert the project to Vue from static HTML/JS/CSS files though so it could scale. The HTML file after 1 feature was getting quite large.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security
Important: All utilities run entirely in your browser. No API tokens or data are stored, cached, or transmitted to any third-party servers. Your Butter CMS token is used only for direct API calls to the official Butter CMS API.

## 🚀 Usage
Simply visit the GitHub Pages site (https://jackdomleo7.github.io/Butter_CMS_Utilities/) and use the utilities with your Butter CMS API token.
